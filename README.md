# Dog_Vision
 
## This notebook builds an end-ton-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.

### Some information about the data:

* We're dealing with images (unstructured data) so it's probably best we use deep learning/transfer learning.
* There are 120 breeds of dogs (this means there are 120 different classes).
* There are around 10,000+ images in the training set (these images have labels)
* There are around 10,000+ images in the test set (these images have no labels, because we'll want to predict them.)
